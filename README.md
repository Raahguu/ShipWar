# ShipWar
100% not BattleShip

This is a projetc I am working on to make a pygame recreation of a navy game, where you attmpt to blindly guess where on a grid the opponent has placed there ships, sending missles to these areas in an attempt to blow up all their ships before they can blow up all of yours. I am currently attempting to make this with `pygame` for the client side, and a local `Docker Container` housing the server for the LAN game using `Flask`.

## Instillation
In order for the program to work, at the moment, you will need `Python`, and `pygame`.
If your downloading on `MacOS` or a `Linux` distro, hopefully you know how to do that, cause I don't.
To download on `Windows 10+` run the following commands in your terminal.

```
winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.13
```
```
pip install pygame
```
